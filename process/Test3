July 1 1999
Golden rays peek through the blinds.
You hear the faint laughter of your daughter in the backyard.
It puts a smile on your face.
You look at the clock, it says 5:00 P.M.
You doze off...
____________________________________________________________tree txt____________________________________________________________
Chunks of your daughters hair hang from the branches.
a doll lays at the stump of the tree.
____________________________________________________________picture txt____________________________________________________________
It's your daughter.
Dark hair tied into small pigtails. 
Curious bright blue eyes.
A white gown falls down to her feet. 
____________________________________________________________news txt____________________________________________________________
...people missing...
____________________________________________________________follow footsteps txt____________________________________________________________
Mud squishes beneath your feet.
the trail stops in front of a tree.
____________________________________________________________examine trail txt____________________________________________________________
You see your daughter's hair on the ground.
____________________________________________________________open light txt____________________________________________________________
You flick on the living room lights.
hey're bright.
To your right, you see a picture
To your left, you see a small TV projecting the news.
____________________________________________________________search room txt____________________________________________________________
The room is cold.
You can't see anything but the faint outlines of furniture.
____________________________________________________________go outside txt____________________________________________________________
It's dark.
You see a trail of small muddy footsteps.
____________________________________________________________call daughter txt____________________________________________________________
#Unsure for now, still in main path
